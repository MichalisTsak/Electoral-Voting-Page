# Electoral-Voting-Page

## AIM:
  The aim of this project was to create a fully front-end and back-end structure for the Electoral Elections. The front-end was done mostly with HTML and CSS,
  while also utilising the Bootstrap framework. The back-end was done using php to retrieve all the necessary information from our database, but also to handle the votes and register them in the database.

## Database Design:
  First we created the following diagrams: 
  1) Entity-relationship

  2) Referential integrity

## Database creation:
  The database was created in a mysql server which we got access through PuTTY. The database was created using mysql. During the semester we also got familiar with views, triggers, transactions, stored procedures and functions but we didn't implement any instances of these due to the structure of the code.
